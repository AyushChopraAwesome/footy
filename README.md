Welcome to the Project 2 for 4WP3: Advanced Web Programming

This project helps you track the data for football/soccer players.
It will track 3 major things:
    1) Their position
    2) Goals Scored
    3) Assists made

Steps to run this project:
1) You will have to install all the dependencies by running : npm install
2) You will need 2 terminal windows for this:
    a) On first terminal windo run "npm run serve-json". This will launch Json server at http://localhost:4000/footy
    b) On second terminal you will run "npm run dev". This will start the app at http://localhost:3000
3) Now you can access the app and will be able to add and edit your players.
